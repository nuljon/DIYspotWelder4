by Jon Nuljon December 2017

A resistance welder with these Functions:
  - Dual Pulse Welds- user configurable timing for pre-weld pulse, pause, main weld pulse
  - 4 selectable default modes: 
			mode 0:  Thermal Controls
			mode 1:  operates per user configured timing
			mode 2:  operates per user configured timing
			mode 3:  continuous main weld pulse until the weld switch is released
  - Thermal protection via temperature controled cooling fan and weld current cutoff at user defined temperatures 
  - LCD display
  - user programmable settings ... coming soon
  - Powered by AC current at approximately  500 amperes. 
         This is achieved by rewinding the core of a microwave oven transformer and connecting it to 2 
         SCR's to control the AC weld current, various switches for mode select and programmable interface,
		 a thermistor to detect the temperarure, transistor to switch a DC fan motor for cooling, 
         a Grove RGB backlight LCD display to give visual signals (resitance welders should not arc),
		 a few resistors, LED, capacitors, diodes, and an Arduino micro controler
		 to rule the the whole pile and run the code.


works with the circuit, SpotWelder v4.0,

circuit is an adaptation 
from Albert van Dalen's board

It is preferred to start weld pulse at peak power. For inductive loads on AC,
the amperage over time will follow the voltage by 90 degress. So calculate the 
weld start time based on mains voltage zero crossing points.
